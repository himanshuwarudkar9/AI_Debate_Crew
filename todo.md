You could have a separate agent for the the agent that is proposing and opposing the motion.

Break that into two different agents and have the tasks going to them separately.

And the reason to do that is that then it's easy to have a different model.

So that you could have OpenAI debate with deep seek or something like that, and then switch who's opposing

and who's proposing to see whether it changes the outcome.

And that's an amusing and entertaining way to battle Llms together, to see which are better at forming

coherent arguments, persuasive arguments that convince a different model that is being the judge.
