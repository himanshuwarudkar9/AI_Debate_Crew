We are currently in the midst of a technological revolution that outpaces our legal frameworks, leaving society vulnerable to unprecedented risks. Strict laws to regulate Large Language Models (LLMs) are not an impediment to innovation; they are a necessary safeguard for democracy, security, and human rights.

First, LLMs pose a unique threat to the information ecosystem. Without strict oversight, these models can be weaponized to generate mass disinformation and deepfakes at a scale that can destabilize elections and erode public trust. Voluntary "ethical guidelines" from tech giants are insufficient; we need legally binding mandates to ensure transparency in training data and the traceability of AI-generated content.

Second, the current "move fast and break things" approach allows for the systemic theft of intellectual property and the violation of personal privacy. LLMs are built on the unauthorized harvesting of human creativity and data. Strict regulation is required to establish a clear legal basis for consent, compensation, and the right to be forgotten.

Finally, we cannot delegate the safety of our digital infrastructure to private corporations motivated by profit. From preventing the use of LLMs in developing biological weapons to ensuring they do not entrench systemic biases in recruitment or healthcare, strict laws provide the only mechanism for real accountability. We must govern AI today, or it will govern us tomorrow.
