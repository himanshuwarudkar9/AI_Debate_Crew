## Evaluation
The debate over whether AI will replace human creativity in the next decade was a clash between technological functionalism (Proposer) and humanistic intentionality (Opposer). 

The Proposer's argument rested on the undeniable trajectory of AI scaling. They correctly identified that in terms of sheer volume, speed, and cost-efficiency, human creators cannot compete. Their argument regarding "Hyper-Personalization" was their most innovative point, suggesting that AI will move beyond mere mimicry to create entirely new modes of experience that are "functionally" superior to static human art.

However, the Opposer successfully countered this by redefining the goalpost from "output" to "intent." The Opposer’s argument regarding **Model Collapse** was the most critical piece of evidence in the debate. It created a logical "ceiling" for AI; if AI models eventually degrade by training on their own data, they remain fundamentally dependent on the "Black Swan" innovations that only humans (who exist outside the algorithmic loop) can provide. 

Furthermore, the Opposer’s "Artisanal Paradox" argument effectively neutralized the Proposer’s economic points. By illustrating that "perfect" reproduction actually increases the value of the "authentic" and "imperfect" human source, the Opposer proved that human creativity will not be replaced, but rather recontextualized as a premium tier of human experience.

Ultimately, the Proposer argued that AI would replace the *industry* of creativity, but the Opposer successfully argued that AI cannot replace the *essence* or the *evolutionary engine* of creativity. Because the motion stated that AI would replace human creativity (the faculty itself), the Opposer's defense of the unique social and innovative role of the human artist was more persuasive.
